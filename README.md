# tik-tok-app-clone
This is an abridged version of the very popular Tik-tok app that I made using React JS, Material UI and Firebase. The video plays on user action and can be paused. For now, I limited it to 2 videos and because the Tik-tok CDN keeps refreshing the video location, they are not available at all times.
